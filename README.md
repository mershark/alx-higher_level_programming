# SQL Course Repository

Welcome to my SQL course repository! This repository contains materials related to my journey through a SQL programming course. Currently, I'm studying SQL through two main modules:

## 0x0D-SQL_introduction

This folder contains introductory SQL scripts and exercises that cover basic concepts and functionalities of SQL databases. Each script addresses specific tasks and concepts taught in the introductory part of the course.

## 0x0E-SQL_more_queries

In the 0x0E-SQL_more_queries folder, you'll find more advanced SQL scripts and queries. These scripts build upon the foundational knowledge gained in the introductory module and cover topics such as advanced queries, table relationships, and database management tasks.

Feel free to explore the contents of each folder to gain insights into the topics covered in my SQL course. I'll be adding more folders and materials as I progress through the course, so stay tuned for updates!

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
