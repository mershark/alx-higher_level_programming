## ALX Full Stack Software Engineering Higher Level Programming Repository

Welcome to my ALX Full Stack Software Engineering higher level programming repository! This repository contains exercises given to me through the ALX program, where I'm learning various aspects of full stack software engineering.

### [0x0D-SQL_introduction](https://github.com/mershark/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x0D-SQL_introduction)

This folder contains introductory SQL scripts and exercises that cover basic concepts and functionalities of SQL databases.

### [0x0E-SQL_more_queries](https://github.com/mershark/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x0E-SQL_more_queries)

In this folder I did more exercises on more advanced SQL scripts and queries. These scripts build upon the foundational knowledge gained in the introductory module and cover topics such as advanced queries, table relationships, and database management tasks.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
