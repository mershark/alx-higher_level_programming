# ALX Full Stack Software Engineering Program Repository

Welcome to my ALX Full Stack Software Engineering program repository! This repository contains materials related to my journey through the ALX program, where I'm learning various aspects of software engineering.

## [0x0D-SQL_introduction](https://github.com/mershark/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x0D-SQL_introduction)

This folder contains introductory SQL scripts and exercises that cover basic concepts and functionalities of SQL databases.

## [0x0E-SQL_more_queries](https://github.com/mershark/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/main/0x0E-SQL_more_queries)

In the 0x0E-SQL_more_queries folder, I did more exercises on more advanced SQL scripts and queries. These scripts build upon the foundational knowledge gained in the introductory module and cover topics such as advanced queries, table relationships, and database management tasks.


If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, please feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
